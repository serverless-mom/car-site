# CarSite demo app

This readme is in two sections: the bit specific for Mike and this job process, and the general readme I'd always write.
# for Mike
## The stack I selected
Server Framework Rails 
JS Framework Angular (right now I'm not doing very much with Angular. In a site this simple I would probably use native Rails unless I knew it would grow or it included search)
UI Framework Bootstrap 
Database Postgres

## Things I would fix for a professional project
* database.yml has raw credentials, something I would *never* do normally, but I wanted to make Postgres deploy as easy as possible for any reviewers.
* commits are not squashed. I want to give as accurate a picture of my 'process' as possible so all origianl commits are here.


* Ruby version 
2.3.0

* System dependencies 


* Configuration

* Database creation
You'll need PostgreSQL 9.3 installed/running and a user with l/p of "polish" and database creation privileges. 

* Database initialization

* Deployment instructions
